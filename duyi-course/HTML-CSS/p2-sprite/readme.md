## Group Sprite Cycles Animation

I'll update the code to display multiple sprite elements, each starting with a different animal and animating independently.

I've completely revamped the code to create multiple sprite elements, each with its own independent animation. Here are the key improvements:

1. **Multiple Sprites**: The page now displays 6 different sprite elements by default (you can easily change this number).

2. **Different Starting Positions**: Each sprite starts with a randomly selected animal from the sprite sheet.

3. **Varied Animation Speeds**: Each sprite animates at a different speed (between 800ms and 1500ms per frame) to create more visual interest.

4. **Interactive Controls**: You can click on any sprite to pause/resume its animation. The sprite becomes slightly transparent when paused.

5. **OOP Approach**: I've used a `SpriteAnimator` class to encapsulate the animation logic for each sprite, making the code more organized and maintainable.

6. **Improved Layout**: The sprites are displayed in a responsive flex container that wraps on smaller screens.

7. **Hover Effects**: Each sprite has a subtle scale animation when hovered, enhancing the interactive feel.

All animations still use requestAnimationFrame for optimal performance, with each sprite tracking its own timing independently.

You can easily customize this further by:
- Changing the `numberOfSprites` variable to display more or fewer sprites
- Adjusting the speed ranges for faster or slower animations
- Modifying the CSS to change the layout or appearance of the sprites
